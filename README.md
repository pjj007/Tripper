## Introduction
In Tripper app, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) is quite simple as it follows the specification given. Once the app is opened, it displays Trip List Fragment which has an empty layout since no trips have been added to the database. Two buttons on the menu (menu icons) which are the Add trip button and settings button. Once the trip has been added it will show a list of trips created by user in the main user interface. It shows the title of the trip, the date the trip was initiated to the database, and destination of the trip. This uses a recycler view within a Linear Layout in the fragment_trip_list.xml file. The layout for the trips for the main user interface is stored in list_item_trip.xml.
